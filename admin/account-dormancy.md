Coder's account dormancy feature allows you to free up license seats if you have
users that aren't active on the platform for 90 days or more.

You can choose to delete a dormant account after a period of time automatically.
For example, you can set Coder to delete accounts 30 days after they go dormant
(this means that the user has been inactive for 120 days: 90 days to become
dormant, plus an additional 30 days).
